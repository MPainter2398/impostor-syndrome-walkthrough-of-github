# Impostor Syndrome Walkthrough of GitHub
Talk from [Kansas City Developer Conference 2017](http://www.kcdc.info/sessions)

#### Abstract
As a long time Windows user and .NET developer, I’ve challenged myself to level-up my skills using Git and GitHub. As an industry, I feel we provide great content for beginners and for experts, but how do we target content for people in the intermediate category? To answer this question, I'm going to blog every. single. day. in 2017 about something new I’ve learned about using Git and GitHub. I’m hoping that showing my day by day progression can help others who are in similar situations, i.e. trying to reskill after years of industry experience.

I've been calling this guide "a penultimate guide" because I don't know what I don't know yet. I don't know which tips will be the best ones for an ultimate guide to Git(Hub). However, by the time KCDC rolls around, I will be more than half way through the Git(Hub) Tip of the Day series. This means I'll be half-way to an ultimate guide for intermediates leveling-up their skills to more advanced topics. This talk will cover the best of the best tips for this half-way point.

## Intro

So about that blog every. single. day. idea... I made it until May 8th or 35% of my goal. I left GitHub earlier that week for a true summer vacation. 

If I could go back in time, this is the readme file I'd give myself. Hopefully you'll (or somebody you know) will find it useful.
