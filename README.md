# Impostor Syndrome Walkthrough of GitHub
Talk from [Kansas City Developer Conference 2017](http://www.kcdc.info/sessions)

#### Abstract
As a long time Windows user and .NET developer, I’ve challenged myself to level-up my skills using Git and GitHub. As an industry, I feel we provide great content for beginners and for experts, but how do we target content for people in the intermediate category? To answer this question, I'm going to blog every. single. day. in 2017 about something new I’ve learned about using Git and GitHub. I’m hoping that showing my day by day progression can help others who are in similar situations, i.e. trying to reskill after years of industry experience.

I've been calling this guide "a penultimate guide" because I don't know what I don't know yet. I don't know which tips will be the best ones for an ultimate guide to Git(Hub). However, by the time KCDC rolls around, I will be more than half way through the Git(Hub) Tip of the Day series. This means I'll be half-way to an ultimate guide for intermediates leveling-up their skills to more advanced topics. This talk will cover the best of the best tips for this half-way point.

## Intro

So, um, about that blog every. single. day. idea... 

I made it until May 8th or **35% of my goal.** I left GitHub (the company) that week for a true summer vacation. Having said that, I still found the challenge rewarding. Forcing myself to blog about what I did **not** know forced me to learn or ask for help.  

If I could go back in time, this is the readme file I'd give myself. It contains the major lightbulb moments where Git(Hub) concepts click. Hopefully you'll (or somebody you know) will find it useful.

P.S. This is a git pun-free zone.

P.P.S. If you are just getting started, jump to the new machine setup section. 

## Part 1 - Visualizing Git Commands

1. **GitHub offers an [excellent cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf).** Print it out! 
2. **Setup your practice area using bash commands**
    - GitHub Services offers On Demand Training - shows [how to use a bash script](https://services.github.com/on-demand/git-trouble/git-set-up) to quickly create a test repo
    - Make sure to `git init` first!
    - See [Tip 086](https://saraford.net/2017/03/27/how-to-write-a-bash-or-powershell-script-to-quickly-create-test-repos-086/) for walkthrough
